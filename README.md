# BooksFX
Was a super basic project that uses database from Oracle's sample code. However after trying to last minute make this fit the requirements without being able to download Apache Derby onto my personal computer, I made a mess. I still tried to add functionality but I have no way of knowing whether anything works or not. 
I would say I adhered to the GUI Design Principles by trying to keep the visuals simple as to avoid cognitive overload and maintained a cohesive interface.

- Database uses Apache Derby
- Uses JavaFX API of version 8.0.171
- Uses Java 1.8.0_144
