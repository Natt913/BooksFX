# BooksFX
Was a super basic project that uses database from Oracle's sample code. However after trying to last minute make this fit the requirements without being able to download Apache Derby onto my personal computer, I made a mess. I still tried to add functionality but I have no way of knowing whether anything works or not. 

- Database uses Apache Derby
- Uses JavaFX API of version 8.0.171
- Uses Java 1.8.0_144
